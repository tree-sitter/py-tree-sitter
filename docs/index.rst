py-tree-sitter
==============

Python bindings to the Tree-sitter parsing library.

Constants
---------

.. autodata:: tree_sitter.LANGUAGE_VERSION

   The latest ABI version that is supported by the current version of the library.

   .. note::

      When a :class:`Language` is generated by the Tree-sitter CLI, it is assigned
      an ABI version number that corresponds to the current CLI version.
      The Tree-sitter library is generally backwards-compatible with languages
      generated using older CLI versions, but is not forwards-compatible.

.. autodata:: tree_sitter.MIN_COMPATIBLE_LANGUAGE_VERSION

   The earliest ABI version that is supported by the current version of the library.
